Welcome!
========

This is the Redox book, which will go through (almost) everything about Redox: design, philosophy, how it works, how you can contribute, how to deploy Redox, and much more.

This book was written by Ticki with the help of LazyOxen, Steve Klabnik, ElijahCaine, and Jackpot51.

If you want to skip straight to trying out Redox, see [getting started](../getting_started/getting_started.html).
